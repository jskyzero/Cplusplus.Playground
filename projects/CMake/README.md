## Overview

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The suite of CMake tools were created by Kitware in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for open-source projects such as ITK and VTK.

The easiest way of using OpenCV in your code is to use CMake. A few advantages (taken from the Wiki):
1. No need to change anything when porting between Linux and Windows
2. Can easily be combined with other tools by CMake( i.e. Qt, ITK and VTK )
